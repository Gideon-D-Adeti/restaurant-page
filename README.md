# Restaurant Homepage Application

This project is a simple restaurant web application that provides basic information about the restaurant, such as the menu and contact details. It was built to practice my skills on Webpack and DOM manipulation.

## Features

- **Tabbed Browsing**: Navigate between Home, Menu, and Contact pages.
- **Homepage**: The homepage contains an image, headline, and information about the restaurant.
- **Menu Page**: Displays the restaurant's menu.
- **Contact Page**: Provides contact information for the restaurant.
